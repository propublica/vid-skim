There are two ways to create a *Video Skimmer* page either you write a JSON Format or an Expanded format. Before launching in we should define a bit of terminology and explain a few quirks:

A *Video Skimmer* is built from a json file which has one or more _divisions_ which in turn have one or more _entries_. Each _division_ is identified by a single word key, (e.g. "Transcript" or "Annotations") and defines the tabs along the top of a *Video Skimmer*. Each _entry_ defines the start and end of each section of transcript and is represented in the right side of each *Video Skimmer*. If two or more _entries_ have the same title they'll be collapsed in the timeline and along the side.

The most straightforward way to create a *Video Skimmer* page is to write a JSON specification. An example of the json structure is in @~/video_skimmer/videos/example.json@, and it conforms to a structure like this:

<pre>
  {
    "youtube_id": "ID of the YouTube video",
    "title": "Title of the video",
    "length": "Length of the video in seconds",
    "default": "Key of the default division to load",
    "divisions": {
      "UniqueDivisionIdentifier": {
        "color": "Color of the timeline in #xxxxxx format",
        "hover": "Hover color of the timeline in #xxxxxx format",
        "entries": [
          {
            "title": "Title of this section",
            "range": ["hh:mm:ss", "hh:mm:ss"]
            "transcript": "<p> html goes here</p>"
          }
          ...
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
</pre>

Once your json is complete, saved in *Video Skimmer* directory under @videos/NAME.json@ and valid (hint: validate with "jsonlint":http://www.jsonlint.com/), run

<pre>
  >> vidskim build ~/video_skimmer
</pre>

in the command line and the html files will show up in the *Video Skimmer* @html@ directory.
 

h2. Expanded

The expanded specification is designed for easier production than json--trailing commas, I'm looking at you--and it's goal is to provide an easy route for defining each *Video Skimmer*. It also is the route that @vidskim parse@ uses (see: [[Writing a Parser]]). 

In order to use the expanded specification first create a new directory in the *Video Skimmer* @videos@ directory to hold a Transcript (@.trans@) file, one or more Division (@.div@) files and one or more Entry (@.entry@) files.

Once your @.trans@, @.div@ and @.entry@ files are complete run:

<pre>
 >> vidskim compile ~/video_skimmer
</pre>

which will compile your entries to a @.json@ file. Then, to output the html in the @html@ directory run:

<pre>
  >> vidskim build ~/video_skimmer
</pre>




h3. .trans Files

The @.trans@ file holds the information about the youtube video, and has the following format (each item separated by a newline):

<pre>
TITLE OF VIDEO
YOUTUBE_ID
DURATION IN SECONDS
DEFAULT TAB
</pre>

|@TITLE OF VIDEO@|The title of the *Video Skimmer*|
|@YOUTUBE_ID@|The youtube id of the video.|
|@DURATION IN SECONDS@|The total seconds of the video.|
|@DEFAULT TAB@|The highlighted tab when the page loads.|

h3. .div Files

Each @.div@ file defines the tabs along the top of each *Video Skimmer* and  has the following format (each item separated by a newline):

<pre>
DIVISION_ID
COLOR IN #XXXXXX FORMAT
HOVER COLOR IN #XXXXXX FORMAT
</pre>

|@DIVISION_ID@|A unique identifier for each division.|
|@COLOR IN #XXXXXX FORMAT@|The color of the timeline for this division.|
|@HOVER COLOR IN #XXXXXX FORMAT@|The hover color of the timeline.|

h3. .entry Files

Each @.entry@ file defines an individual entry in the transcript and has the following format (each item separated by a newline):

<pre>
DIVISION_ID
TITLE
['00:00:00', '00:00:00']
<p>
  HTML HERE (CAN BE MULTIPLE LINES)
</p>
</pre>

|@DIVISION_ID@|The unique identifier for the division associated with this entry.|
|@TITLE@| The title of the entry, it appears along the timeline and the side rail of the *Video Skimmer*|
|@['00:00:00', '00:00:00']@|The range in @'hh:mm:ss'@ format, start and end.|
|@<p>HTML HERE</p>@|Each entry can have one or more lines of html code.|
