We had essentially about two duffel bags, if you will, sized -- we had two duffel bags worth of equipment apiece approximately. A lot of the equipment that was required for our contact was procured or acquired in Baghdad.<\/p><p><b>What kinds of equipment did you need to acquire in Baghdad?<\/b><\/p><p>We purchased vehicles and we purchased weapons off the black market. We purchased ammunition. We purchased a significant amount of Cuban cigars and liquor, which were traded for U.S. military equipment in Baghdad and the surrounding area.<\/p>","title":"Purchases","range":["00:00:00","00:01:16"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>You mentioned that vehicles were purchased actually in Baghdad?<\/b><\/p><p>Under the terms of our call order, Triple Canopy acquired as contractor-purchased equipment on behalf of the U.S. government 56 what we call \"soft\" vehicles, which are non-armored vehicles. They were locally purchased in Baghdad.<\/p><p>A lot of high-end sedans are common in Baghdad, like BMW 740s, Mercedes 600 series and 500 series sedans. We purchased those types of vehicles and we purchased a few utilitarian trucks and stuff like that.<\/p><p>There was a specific automobile dealership that we dealt with when we first started purchasing vehicles over there. We got titles with each vehicle. When the whole thing was over I think we were missing titles on probably 25, 24, 25 vehicles, which I thought indicated they were stolen vehicles.<\/p><p><b>Do you know how Triple Canopy managed to acquire vehicles that didn't have titles?<\/b><\/p><p>It's a cash economy in Iraq. There is no electronic funds transfer. There is no -- when you're dealing with locals at this time in 2004, so we paid cash.<\/p><p>My initial concern, which I relayed to Mr. Nicholson, is that these vehicles are a lot more expensive than what we were purchasing for. We were getting $60-$70,000 vehicles for $25-30,000. As long as we had the title we were good with that. When the titles stopped coming in the requirement to be contract compliant and purchase the vehicles as specified by the contract superseded the need to have a title. So the vehicles were purchased anyway.<\/p>","title":"Vehicles","range":["00:01:16","00:03:26"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>You talked about the vehicles. You also mentioned that there were some weapons purchased from the black market. What did you mean by that?<\/b><\/p><p>Triple Canopy purchased over 900 AK-47 rifles on the black market, several machine guns, PKM machine guns. RPK long barrel AK-47s, several Dragunov sniper rifles. These weapons were purchased through connections that we had in Baghdad, local connections from --<\/p><p>Well, there is no legal way to purchase weapons over there. So you're either supporting organized crime or you're supporting the insurgency. Organized crime is not allowed to operate over there without paying some sort of -- without it being under the -- the insurgency knows about these activities and I believe there is a tax paid to allow them to operate.<\/p><p>Additionally, to weapons purchased from the insurgents or the black market, Triple Canopy received a letter from Mr. Chris Vauxhall of the Coalition Provisional Authority, which allowed Triple Canopy to acquire captured enemy weapons at U.S. Army Corps collection points.<\/p><p>Tony Nicholson directed Triple Canopy to acquire these weapons whenever possible, to make regular stops at these collection points, and to acquire these weapons, and bring them back.<\/p><p>If they were functional they were to be used by our personnel; if they were nonfunctional, his guidance was, as long as it's got a serial number, we can tell the government we purchased it and turn that in at the end of the contract when this contract is reconciled. So they were acquired for free and the intention was to use them as contractor-purchased equipment.<\/p>","title":"Weapons","range":["00:03:26","00:05:45"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>Did you raise any concerns with Tony Nicholson about using those collection point collected weapons as contractor-purchased equipment?<\/b><\/p><p>I did not initially, and the reason was when we first went over there it was a mad scramble to get the equipment that we needed to be operational. We went over there with no weapons, with very little equipment beyond personal gear such as body armor. So initially the big push was to get weapons so that we could protect ourselves and we could protect our customers, Department of State diplomats.<\/p><p>Then once that amount was exceeded -- generally youhave one weapon per man and 10 percent sparing is the standard logistic lowdown for weapons. Once that was exceeded I began to look at it a little closer, because I tracked all expenditures for Triple Canopy's operations in Iraq every penny the first year.<\/p>","title":"Official Response to Weapons Collection","range":["00:05:45","00:06:53"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><em>(continued ...)<\/em><\/p><p>Once the amount that seemed to be prudent was exceeded, I questioned why we were continuing to purchase weapons.<\/p><p>Because it was a significant cash outlay for those that were actually purchased, approximately $250 per AK; pistols, we probably had 15-20 pistols. They are a lot more expensive because they're a lot easier to conceal. They're $600 apiece. PKR machine guns depending on the condition are $800 to $1,200 apiece. The Dragunov sniper rifles are $600. Long barrel AKs, approximately $450, $500.","title":"Weapons Cost","range":["00:06:53","00:07:36"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>The insurgency you mentioned, those are the people that the United States are fighting over there in Iraq; correct?<\/b><\/p><p>That's correct.<\/p><p><b>The dollars that Triple Canopy recieved from the United States government, was that part of the money that it used to purchase these weapons and cars you talked about?<\/b><\/p><p>Absolutely. Triple Canopy essentially took out a bunch of loans to finance their business, which is not uncommon. Those loans were repaid with U.S. government tax dollars, fee-for-service. We were providing a security service, the government paid us a fee. So essentially tax dollars were used to buy insurgent weapons.<\/p><p><b>Which funded the insurgency?<\/b><\/p><p>That's correct.<\/p><p><b>Objection. Argumentative<\/b><\/p><p>Yes, that is correct.<\/p>","title":"Funding the Insurgency","range":["00:07:36","00:08:31"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>Now, you also mentioned something about Cuban cigars and liquor that was purchased for trade. Would you explain what you meant, what that was about?<\/b><p><p>There was a very strong guidance from Tony Nicholson that U.S. soldiers were not to be paid cash for the equipment that they were giving us. And so what was arranged was a barter system, where If somebody allowed us to have this equipment -- which was surplus, which was not being --<\/p><p>A lot of these units were getting ready to rotate back to the states. They had more gear than they were going to carry back and there was just an unbelievable amount of war material over there. So rather than having to account for it or store it or ship it back to the states, the guys responsible for this equipment were more than happy to give it away, in exchange for that they would be provided with a bottie of liquor or a box of  Cuban cigars as a trade or a favor.<\/p>","title":"Barter System","range":["00:08:31","00:09:50"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>What kinds of equipment did Triple canopy  obtain through this barter system?<\/b><\/p> <p>Essentially everything, including AT4 rockets, which were deemed unusable by the U.S. military. We  acquired them because they were in fact still serviceable.  We had six AT4 rockets at our headquarters.<\/p>  <p>We acquired over one and a half-million  dollars worth of medical supplies. We had an outstanding  medical suite. Part of our staffing was physician's  assistants and most of these people were former Special  Operations medics.<\/p> <p> So what we had was essentially a trauma suite,  a two-bed trauma suite with everything that a modem medical facility has to take care of guys that get shot or injured from glass damage. Heavy-duty trauma stuff.  We had medicines, we had equipment. We were outfitted better than most field units that did not have an actual  CASH unit, a medical unit.<\/p>","title":"Barter System","range":["00:09:50","00:11:07"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><em>(cont ...)<\/em><\/p><p>We got the literally thousands of boxes of food. One of the things that we did over there was we wanted to be prepared for any type of siege situation. Where we were staying in the Green Zone in a house there, a 14,700 square foot house - I had to take the measurements once for project I was working on.<\/p>   <p>But at any rate, one of the first priorities  for us was to secure enough water and food to withstand up  to a two-month siege. So we had a significant amount of   U.S. Army supplied food, primarily T-rations. A T-ration  is a big aluminum tray with a foil top; Three T-rations  together will feed 40 guys one meal. We had hundreds of  cases of those. <\/p> <p>We had dozens of pallets of bottled water. We  had - I think we already covered medical supplies. We  outfitted over 200 guys with trauma kits, bandages,  medicines, things that they need for personal first aid.  Each vehicle was supplied with a trauma kit to take care  of the customer in the event that he was injured.  <\/p> <p> We got a 5,000 gallon fuel truck. We got a  tractor. We got -- <\/p>","title":"Barter System","range":["00:11:07","00:12:54"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>But the majority of the weapons that Triple Canopy got through the black market were Soviet make?<\/b> <\/p> <p>Yes. Although there were some Browning High Powers. There were a couple of Smith & Wesson revolvers, a couple of Walther PPKs. We were getting a wide variety of stuff at first. And then there were -- a couple of things happened.<\/p> <p>We put in a request, an export license and an end-user certificate for the Department of State. Unfortunately, the Department of state takes many, many months to grant these approvals. And in the meantime we had to have an operational capability, which meant we had to have weapons So we did not get authorization to purchase high-quality U.S. made weapons (where are Glocks made? Germany?) High-quality U.S. and European weapons until maybe May or June. And in the meantime our contract stipulated that we had to have a full operational capability. We started the first one 15 February, the next one 15 March, the next one 15 April. <\/p> <p>So we had to have full operational capability in order to be contract compliant on those dates. So we purchased the weapons required for that on the black market. The whole mind set at the time was whatever it takes to get the job done we're going to do it.<\/p>","title":"The Black Market Connection","range":["00:12:54","00:14:32"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>Did you discuss it with anyone else at Triple Canopy besides Tony Nicholson?<\/b> <\/p><p>It was a general subject of conversation among senior folks, that you know, we're spending a lot of money on these rifles, millions of dollars here. Where do you think that money is going to? Who are we supporting in doing that? We're supporting people who are trying to kill Americans is the logical conclusion.<\/p>","title":"Supporting the Insurgency","range":["00:14:32","00:14:57"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>So I understand the sources of Triple Canopy's  armaments -- and I'm specifically only am talking about weapons here -- some were purchased from the blackmarket some were gotten through collection points of captured weapons manned by the Army, and Triple Canopy also had an  export license and end user certificate from the Department of State, Whereby it could acquire U.S. and  European weapons.<\/b> <\/p> <p>That's correct.<\/p> <p><b>Were there other sources of weapons that Triple canopy had in Iraq?<\/b><\/p> <p>They got a few U.S. Army weapons that were specifically those AT4 rockets that were considered, not serviceable anymore by the Army. So when they are, given that designation of not serviceable, they are taken off the record books as expended, well, they weren't actually expended.<\/p> <p>A typical example would be a dust seal on the end of the rocket was broken. It is highly likely that dust would get in there and contaminate the rocket's guidance and launch propulsion mechanism. And so it is unsafe to use at that time by U.S. Army standards, which  are pretty high.<\/p> <p>So they survey the weapon, say this is no longer usable and it is taken off the books. It still works and we took them. We had them. You know; in addition to the AKs we had a  significant number of RPGs also, which I had not mentioned yet.<\/p>","title":"Unusable Rockets","range":["00:14:57","00:16:35"],"annotation":null,"extra":"<img src=\"http:\/\/www.propublica.org\/images\/tubes\/assets\/flickr_at4_200px_090909.jpg\"\/><br \/>A soldier firing an AT4 rocket launcher.

The actual contract is between the company which has the authorization and the manufacturer here in the States. In our case that was Colt Manufacturing for M4s and Glock for our 9mm pistols. And we also had some Armorlite AR10s for precision fire, essentially sniper weapons.<\/p> <p> <b>But the purchases that you made through the State Department export licenses and the end-use certificate from Colt those are legitimate purchases?<\/b><\/p> <p>Say that again. please.<\/p><p><b>The purchases that you made through the export license-and the end-use certificate, from Colt are all lawful purchases?<\/b><\/p> <p>Yes.<p>  <p><b>Was there anything illegal about the acquisition of weapons deemed unserviceable by the U.S Army?<\/b><\/p>  <p>Well, I believe it is illegal to hold U.S Army Department of Defense weapons. I mean, unless you're contract specifically states, that you are authorized to be issued US. military weapons it is highly illegal for a civilian to own a government weapon or to have possession of one.<\/p>","title":"The Legal Question","range":["00:16:35","00:18:46"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>Did the U.S. government know about the black market AKs that Triple Canopy possessed?<\/b> <\/p> <p>I don't think so. At this time you have to put things in context. There was virtually zero oversight on any of these security companies In Iraq at that time. There were no questions asked about -- nobody ever said where Is your export license and end-user certificate; and compared to the date that those documents were received and the date when they had weapons that were supposed to be operationally capable. And there was pretty much a blind eye turned to all of that. <\/p> <p><b>Do you know whether the State of Defense, or any other U.S. entity ever took an inventory of Triple Canopy's weapons?<\/b> <\/p> <p>No. In fact, the government was not concerned with the inventory a company has. The primary concern the government has is are we getting the service we're paying for. In this particular case they really don't care that happens. They just want the service.<\/p>","title":"Lack of Oversight","range":["00:18:46","00:20:17"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":"<p><b>Well first of all, who ends up buying the weapons back from Triple Canopy?<\/b><\/p> <p>They are not bought back from Triple Canopy They are turned over to the government because they are government items. The company, Triple Canopy, purchased them on behalf of the government.<\/p> <p><b>I understand. So effectively what happens is Triple Canopy purchases the items, not to possess it but simply to use it during the course of its work in Iraq and then the idea is it will turn it back into the government at the conclusion because it's the government's weapon? <\/b><\/p><p> That's correct. <\/p> <p><b>And in some cases AKs that were purchased on the black market were turned back over to the government as contractor purchased weapons?<\/b> <\/p> <p>Yes. <\/p> <p> <b>And those had actually been purchased?<\/b><\/p> <p> Yes.<\/p> <p><b>And'the same with all the weapons you got from Colt? <\/b><\/p><p>Yes.<\/p> <p><b>So the only category of weapons we're talking about that got turned back over to the government, that were not actually purchased by Triple Canopy, were some of the ones you got from the collection points? <\/b> <\/p><p>Yes. <\/p> <p><b>And the ones you turned back over to the government that Triple Canopy had not paid for, were those primarily non-functioning ones? <\/b><\/p><p> Some were functional and some were not. Again, the key point being a serial number. That's how weapons are tracked, a serial number that is etched into the receiver. The main component of a firearm. <\/p>","title":"Tracking the Weapons","range":["00:20:17","00:22:13"],"annotation":null,"extra":""},{"transcript":" <p><b>I hope you understand how this would happen then. If Triple Canopy had acquired the firearm at one of the collection points, and then turned it back over to the government wouldn't the government have a that that particular serial number had not been purchased?<\/b><\/p> <p> No. Because when these weapons were collected from the collection points, when they were acquired from the collection points they did not go out by serial number. They just said, yeah, take them. There was no paperwork associated with that. <\/p> <p>We typically would show up on the letter of authorization saying, hey look, we can have them, give them to us and depending on the mood. of the particular guard there, you could either get them or they could tell you no. So it was pretty haphazard. <\/p> <p><b>And did you previously testify that with regard to the weapons received from the collection points, you got about 200 AKs and some cats and dogs?<\/b> <\/p> <p>Yes <\/p> <p><b>Of those weapons, of those 200, how many were turned back into the government as contractor-purchase weapons?<\/b> <\/p> <p>I do not know. <\/p> <p><b>Do you have an estimate?<\/b> <\/p> <p>I would estimate, since they were essentially unserviceable or in poor condition probably everyone they could. <\/p> <p><b>By everyone they could, is that all 200 or some percentage less than that? I would bet you money it was all of them, however, I do not have direct knowledge of that. <\/b> <\/p><p><b>When you say you don't have direct knowledge, you don't have the direct knowledge of whether these weapons were serviceable? <\/b><\/p> <p>No. I don't know if they were serviceable and I don't know if they were actually depicted as a contractor-purchased equipment.

When I left Iraq those contracts were still in effect. So the custody chain of those weapons remains with the contractor until the end of the contract. As those contracts rollover eventually the end.
